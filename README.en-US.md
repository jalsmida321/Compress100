## Highlights

- Import, convert, optimise, and proportionally resize JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF files
- Automatically compare candidate formats and choose a smaller result with limited visual loss
- Before/after preview, actual output size, continuous quality and scale controls, and text watermarks
- Limit output to 200 KB, 100 KB, 50 KB, or a custom size using measured quality and dimension adjustments
- Import an entire folder recursively; large batches use the same low-memory queue
- Clipboard monitoring, global shortcuts, watched folders, and a local result library
- Clop-inspired floating results with copy, preview, undo, further downscaling, and format switching, plus clear success or failure feedback in the lower-left status area
- Configurable result limit, stacked/list layouts, and automatic dismissal
- Replace, rename beside the source, or export to a fixed folder with scheduled cleanup
- Upload to WebDAV, S3/R2, OSS, FTP, or SFTP image hosts
- Load local HTML/JavaScript or URL workbench plugins; the library and folder watcher can also be toggled independently
- Tauri 2 + Rust desktop apps; images stay on your device by default

### Floating-window workflow

The desktop app can open its floating window from a global shortcut, copied image, dropped file, or the local image picker, without opening the full workbench first. After the smart first pass, hover over the preview to copy, preview, reveal, undo, downscale again, switch formats, add a watermark, or upload. Floating results are draggable and resizable, support cycling stacks and expanded lists, result limits and automatic dismissal, and let you choose up to six action buttons in Settings.

## Download

Get the latest installers from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/amiaoapp/PicLite/releases):

- Windows x64 / ARM64: `.exe` or `.msi`
- macOS Apple Silicon / Intel: `.dmg`
- Linux x64 / ARM64: `.AppImage` or `.deb`

The current macOS builds use ad-hoc signing. On first launch, macOS may require approval in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

## Web and Docker

The [GitHub Pages demo](https://amiaoapp.github.io/PicLite/) is a static, install-free build. Images are processed locally in your browser and are not uploaded to a server. Use the desktop app for the system tray, global shortcuts, persistent clipboard monitoring, and watched folders.

For a LAN deployment, custom domain, or your own service endpoint, use the GHCR image. The default service port is `3456`.

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amiaoapp/PicLite.git
cd PicLite
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Upgrade, inspect status, and follow logs:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f piclite
```

Create a `.env` file in the project directory to change the bind address, host port, or image tag:

```dotenv
PICLITE_BIND=0.0.0.0
PICLITE_PORT=3456
PICLITE_TAG=1.5.0
```

To build from the current source tree instead:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name piclite \
  -p 3456:3456 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/amiaoapp/piclite:latest
```

Open `http://SERVER_IP:3456`. Both the GitHub Pages and Docker web builds include the compression workspace; browser security restrictions prevent system-tray, global-shortcut, and persistent folder-monitoring features.

For a reverse proxy, forward your domain to `http://127.0.0.1:3456`. Caddy example:

```caddyfile
piclite.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3456
}
```

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.13+, stable Rust, and the Tauri 2 system dependencies for your target platform.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run desktop:dev
```

Test and build:

```bash
npm test
npm run desktop:build
```

## Create a workbench plugin

PicLite plugins are no longer embedded with an `iframe`. The desktop app fetches HTML/CSS/JavaScript and mounts it in a trusted workbench runtime, avoiding `X-Frame-Options` failures and allowing a custom tab name. Install only code you trust.

A minimal plugin is a single HTML file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<main id="tool">
  <h1>My image tool</h1>
  <button id="ready">Done</button>
</main>
<script>
  document.querySelector("#ready").onclick = () => {
    window.PicLitePlugin.post("ready", { ok: true });
  };
</script>
```

Open Settings → Plugins to import `.html`, `.js`, or `manifest.json`, or enter a custom name and HTTPS URL for the desktop app to fetch. Manifest example:

```json
{
  "nameZh": "封面设计大师",
  "nameEn": "Banner Maker",
  "url": "https://example.com/plugin/"
}
```

See the full [plugin development guide](docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.en-US.md) for the runtime API, asset URL rules, and publishing notes.

## Privacy and licence

Optimisation runs locally in the browser or desktop app. Files leave your device only when you explicitly upload them to a storage provider you configured.
